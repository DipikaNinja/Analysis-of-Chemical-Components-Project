    "<p>Whenever I want to try a new cosmetic item, it's so difficult to choose. It's actually more than difficult. It's sometimes scary because new items that I've never tried end up giving me skin trouble. We know the information we need is on the back of each product, but it's really hard to interpret those ingredient lists unless you're a chemist. You may be able to relate to this situation.</p>\n",

In this notebook, we are going to create a content-based recommendation system where the 'content' will be the chemical components of cosmetics. Specifically, we will process ingredient lists for 1472 cosmetics on Sephora via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding\">word embedding</a>, then visualize ingredient similarity using a machine learning method called t-SNE and an interactive visualization library called Bokeh. Let's inspect our data first.</p>"

The axes of a t-SNE plot aren't easily interpretable in terms of the original data. Like mentioned above, t-SNE is a visualizing technique to plot high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space. Therefore, it's not desirable to interpret a t-SNE plot quantitatively.</p>\n",

By looking at the ingredients, we can visually confirm the compositions of the products are similar (<em>though it is difficult to do, which is why we did this analysis in the first place!</em>), plus LANEIGE's version is $22 cheaper and actually has higher ratings.</p>\n",
